# build-tools

This directory contains source for the various build tools used during
curriculum development within the Education department at Databricks.

* `bdc`: *B*uild *D*atabricks *C*ourse: This is the main build tool.
* `gendbc`: Create Databricks DBC files from the command line.
* `master_parse`: The master notebook parse tool and module.

Ensure that you have a Python 2 environment (preferably, a virtual environment)
and a Java 8 JDK. Make sure `java` is in your PATH. Also, it helps to have
`JAVA_HOME` set.

## Shortcut Install

Run this command in a Python 2 environment:

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling
```

It'll take a few minutes, but it will download and install all three pieces.

## Manual install 

Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and type `python setup.py install`.

## Manual install individually

You can also install each tool individually. Consult the README in `bdc`.
