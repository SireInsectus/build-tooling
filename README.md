# build-tools

This directory contains source for the various build tools used during
curriculum development within the Education department at Databricks.

* `bdc`: *B*uild *D*atabricks *C*ourse: This is the main build tool.
* `gendbc`: Create Databricks DBC files from the command line.
* `master_parse`: The master notebook parse tool and module.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have a Python 2 environment (preferably, an activated virtual
  environment).
* Ensure that you have a Java 7 or Java 8 JDK and that `java` is in your path.
  Java 9 is _not supported._ 
* `gendbc` will be installed in `$HOME/local/bin`. Make sure `$HOME/local/bin` 
  is in your path, or your builds will fail.

## Virtual Python Environment

_bdc_ is currently limited to Python 2.

While it is possible to build the courseware by installing the necessary
software in the system-installed (or Homebrew-installed) Python, **it is not
recommended**. It's much better to run the build from a dedicated Python
virtual environment. This document describes how to do that. If you want to
use the system version of Python, you're on your own (because it's
riskier).

### Install `pip`

You'll have to install `pip`, if it isn't already installed. First,
download `get-pip.py` from here:
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>

Once you have `get-pip.py`, install `pip`.

* If you're on Linux, run this command: `sudo /usr/bin/python get-pip.py`
* If you're on a Mac and _not_ using Homebrew: `sudo /usr/bin/python get-pip.py`
* If you're on a Mac and using a Homebrew-installed Python: `/usr/local/bin/python get-pip.py`
* If you're on Windows and you used the standard installer: `C:\Python27\python get-pip.py`

### Install `virtualenv`

* Linux: `sudo pip install virtualenv`
* Mac and not using Homebrew: `sudo pip install virtualenv`
* Mac with Homebrew-install Python: `/usr/local/bin/pip install virtualenv`
* Windows: `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install virtualenv`

### Create a virtual environment

Create a virtual Python environment for the build. You can call it anything
you want, and you can create it any where you want. Let's assume you'll
call it `dbbuild` and put it in your home directory. Here's how to create
the virtual environment.

From a command window, assuming you're in your home directory:

* Linux or Mac: `virtualenv dbbuild`
* Windows: `C:\Python27\Scripts/virtualenv dbbuild`

### Activate the virtual environment

Once you have the virtual Python environment installed, you'll need to
activate it. **You have to activate the environment any time you create a
new command window.**

(For complete details on using `virtualenv`, see <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>.)

* Linux or Mac: `. $HOME/dbbuild/bin/activate`
* Windows: `dbbuild\bin\activate.bat`


## Installing the Build Tools

If you have never installed the tools in your virtual Python environment, run
this command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling
```

If you have installed the tools before, run:

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling
```

This installation script will install:

* `bdc`
* `master_parse`
* `gendbc`
* `databricks-cli`

It'll take a few minutes, but it will download and install all three pieces.

## Manual install 

Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and type `python setup.py install`.
