# build-tools

This directory contains source for the various build tools used during
curriculum development within the Education department at Databricks.

* `bdc`: *B*uild *D*atabricks *C*ourse: This is the main build tool.
* `gendbc`: Create Databricks DBC files from the command line.
* `master_parse`: The master notebook parse tool and module.

**Prerequisites**

* Ensure that you have a Python 2 environment (preferably, an activated virtual
  environment).
* Ensure that you have a Java 7 or Java 8 JDK and that `java` is in your path.
  Java 9 is _not supported._ 
* `gendbc` is installed in `$HOME/local/bin`. Make sure `$HOME/local/bin` is in
  your path, or your builds will fail.

## Shortcut Install

Run this command in a Python 2 environment:

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling
```

It'll take a few minutes, but it will download and install all three pieces.

## Manual install 

Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and type `python setup.py install`.

## Manual install individually

You can also install each tool individually. Consult the README in `bdc`.
